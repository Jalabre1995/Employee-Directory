# Challenges

The promblems that occured during this project was getting heroku to work for. When I did git remote -v and did git remote add-origin, the files were building in heroku, but still not pushing through.

# Future 
There still more work that needs t be done for th eproject. The input and searchBtn are close to the right side fo the screen. And definatley workign on getting Heroku up and runnng.
